## Features

- User registration and authentication
- Real-time chat functionality
- User profile management
- Message history and notifications

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB: A NoSQL database used for storing user information and chat messages.
- Express.js: A web application framework used for building the server-side of the application.
- React.js: A JavaScript library used for building the user interface.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment used for running the server-side code.

## Getting Started
